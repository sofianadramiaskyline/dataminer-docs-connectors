# ZTE ZXDU

## Overview

The ZTE ZXDU is a Centralized System Management Unit (CSU501B) designed for front-end monitoring of the communication DC power supply system. It plays a crucial role in tracking and managing the operational status of the system, ensuring efficient and reliable power management.

The CSU501B features an RJ45 Ethernet interface for network connectivity, a USB interface for data export, indicators for system status, an LCD for display, and buttons for navigation and settings.

It includes multiple functions:

- **Management**: The CSU501B supports comprehensive management features, including charging, discharging, and test management of battery sets. It also controls the automatic sleep of rectifiers to save energy and exports historical records through a USB flash drive.

- **Alarm**: When faults occur, the CSU501B reports alarms and takes protective measures, including over-voltage protection (output), and over-/under-voltage protection (input).

- **Monitoring**: Operational data of the power system is collected, and its status is monitored in real time. The device can report data to the Supervision Center and monitor the power system remotely.

- **Wireless Communication**: The unit supports GPRS and 3G network modes, providing SMS and email notifications for efficient remote communication.

- **Web Functions**: With network connectivity, users can access the CSU501B using Chrome to read data in real time and configure the unit.

- **SNMP**: When connected to a network, SNMP software can be used for real-time data reading and configuration of the CSU501B.
